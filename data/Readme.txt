$Content$This is a demo version of Isles, we are still working hard to make this game bug free :)
 
We gave up on the race 'Steamer' at the last minute since there're some unfinished models and textures :(. But we promise to bring it back on stage in future releases.
 
You can adjust game graphics settings by modifying 'Settings.xml' in the game folder. There are several pre-defined setting files available so you can just copy and paste them.
 
It is not recommended that you press ALT+TAB in fullscreen mode.
